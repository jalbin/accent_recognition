*\"Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the
store: Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese,
and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic
snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can scoop these things into
three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train
station.\"*
