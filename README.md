Project| ACCENT RECOGNITION



![image.png](flag.png)



Native and non-native speakers of English read the same paragraph and
are carefully transcribed. Our goal is to compare, analyze
and predict the accents of different English speakers.



The elicitation paragraph is the following:

*\"Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the
store: Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese,
and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic
snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can scoop these things into
three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train
station.\"*
